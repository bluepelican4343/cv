            <h3>Current Work Experience</h3>
            <P> I am the owner of a now <strong>defunct</strong> company that once sold tickets</P>
            <p>I was working at this company for several years and created a database of sales that has
                endured for all of the time that the company has been in existence. Principally I have 
                maintained this database using a Mac running OS 9.2. I had to replace the Mac once and
                purchased a replica from ebay. I also had to find an old printer once that would be
                recognized by that Mac. So to maintain this database for around 20 years, I had to 
                originally purchase the software, repurchase a Mac, and repurchase a printer. These kept costs 
                low for the duration of the company. This old mac requires a direct telephone connection 
                and therefore has not been connected to the internet in years, thereby preventing any
                hacking by outsiders. A cheap and oddly successful decision made when the company began.
